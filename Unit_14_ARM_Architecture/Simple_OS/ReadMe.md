# Embedded_System_Online_Diploma

## ARM Architecture Course

This LAB was a Simple OS where the scheduler has a specific stack region and use MSP(Main Stack Pointer) , Also each TASK has a specific stack region and use PSP(Process Stack Pointer) ,First: We consider the EXTI is our Scheduling point between TaskA and TaskB. Then I improved this LAB by adding SysTick Timer and it set a periodic interval as a Scheduling point.

If you're interested in exploring the code and diving deeper into the details, you can find it above: 
1) Using EXTI
2) Using SysTick

Throughout this LAB, we covered some key concepts, including:

1️⃣ ARM Operating Modes and Access Levels:
   - Switching Operating Modes between Thread Mode and Handler Mode
   - Switching Access Levels between Privileged and Unprivileged

2️⃣ Stack Memory and SP:
   - Understanding the switch between MSP and PSP

Stay tuned for my upcoming updates on the Full RTOS, where I'll be sharing even more exciting developments. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss embedded systems further.
